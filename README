1. What's this?

   This is "Mac port" addition to GNU Emacs 24 by Yamamoto Mitsuharu
   <mituharu@math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp>. This provides a native GUI support
   for Mac OS X 10.4 - 10.8.  Note that Emacs 23 already contains the
   official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for Mac OS X 10.4 and
   later.  So if it is good enough for you, then you don't need to try
   this.

   *** IMPORTANT NOTE ***

   [If you find a bug of the prebuilt emacs bundle, build-emacs.app.sh
   and emacs-mac.rb, please feel free to open a issue on github.]

   If you find a bug, then please try to reproduce it with some
   official builds such as X11 or NS (Cocoa).  If it turns out to be
   specific to the Mac port, then please report it to
   "mituharu+bug-gnu-emacs-mac@math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp".  Otherwise
   (i.e., it is also reproducible with official ones), report it using
   M-x report-emacs-bug *USING THE OFFICIAL BUILD* as such.

   Emacs Mac port is now active developing by Mr Yamamoto Mitsuharu
   <mituharu@math.s.chiba-u.ac.jp> by publishing patches on
   emacs-devel mailing list. This is *not* an official repo.

   More about this fork, please read README-mac.

2. How to install 

   Plan A.
   	Without clone and compile, just download from

        https://www.dropbox.com/s/ql99ytm7h5km633/emacs-mac-port-24.2.91-mac-3.91.zip

        If you prefer the official Emacs icon (the "E" and a pan), please download this

       https://www.dropbox.com/s/sx5tpej6ojczbvp/emacs-mac-port-24.2.91-mac-3.91-official-icon.zip

    * Tested on Mac OS X 10.8.2/10.7.5*
	
   Plan B. 
   	Build a self-contained Emacs.app with build-emacs.app.sh
    * under construction now :( *

   Plan C.  
   	If you are using Homebrew, copy "emacs-mac.rb" to your brew's
   	formula directory(usually at /usr/local/Library/Formula/), and
       
        $ brew install --HEAD emacs-mac

   Plan D. 
   	1). Get the latest code from git repository

       	  if you are new here:
      	     $ git clone git://github.com/railwaycat/emacs-mac-port.git
      
	  if you cloned this repository before:
     	     $ git pull

    2). Follow the step h. i. j. in "2. Build instructions" from
	README-mac

      	  You can SKIP step a. b. c. d. e. f. and g. because code in this
      	  repository was patched already.
