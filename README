1. What's this?

   This is "Mac port" addition to GNU Emacs 23 by Yamamoto Mitsuharu. This
   provides a native GUI support for Mac OS X 10.2 - 10.6.  Note that Emacs 23
   already contains the official GUI support via the NS (Cocoa) port for Mac
   OS X 10.4 and later.  So if it is good enough for you, then you don't need
   to try this.

   More about this fork, please read README-mac.
